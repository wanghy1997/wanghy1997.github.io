Hello everyone, I am **Hongyi Wang**, currently studying for a **👨‍🎓Ph.D.** at **🏫Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications (CQUPT)**. 

My supervisors are Professor **Xinbo Gao** and Associate Professor **Jiaxu Leng**.

## 🔍 Research interests
- 🧠 Medical Image Analysis
- 🤝 Human-in-the-Loop Learning
- 📊 Active learning and Uncertainty Modeling
- ⚙️ Explainable AI

I am passionate about developing intelligent algorithms and interactive frameworks that empower medical image understanding, computer-aided diagnosis, and clinical decision support.

My work emphasizes not only improving model accuracy, but also enhancing interpretability and practicality. In particular, I focus on exploring strategies for learning effectively with limited annotations through human-machine collaboration and active learning.

I am always open to discussions and collaborations in medical AI, human-in-the-loop methods, and interdisciplinary research at the intersection of healthcare and artificial intelligence.
